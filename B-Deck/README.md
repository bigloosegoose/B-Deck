## Introduction

B-Deck is a macropad made by Battak(me) for Hackpad.

## Why I made this?
1. I fell into the keyboard rabbit hole
2. It was fun and i learnt new things
3. Custom keyboards go brrrrr
4. I wanted a macropad for playing osu!

## Challenges
1. I had no idea what i am doing, I just connected random wires till everything looked good
2. It was my first time and had to face the steep learning curve
